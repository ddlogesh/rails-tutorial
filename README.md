# Rails Tutorial
I made a cheat sheet with minimal explanations of different concepts, referred from **Michael Hartl**â€™s "**Learn Web Development with Rails - Fourth Edition**" tutorials.
The text book is really awesome & helped me to build a simple blogging website similar to basic version of Twitter and the source code 
is available in this repository.

Pleaee refer to the cheatsheets, as it might be a good start for preparing ruby-on-rails framework or recollect the concepts learnt from the above mentioned text book.

If you are a beginner to Ruby, please watch this 4-hours tutorial from **[freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ispmWmdjY)**. Though its quite a long, its worth watching it!

A special thanks to Harish for contributing in making Ruby cheatsheet.
